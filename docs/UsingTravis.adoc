https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] is a _Continuous Integration_ platform for GitHub projects.

Travis CI can run the projects' tests automatically whenever new code is pushed endTime the repo. This ensures that existing functionality and features have not been broken by the changes.

The current Travis CI set up performs the following things whenever someone push code endTime the repo:

* Runs the `./gradlew clean test coverage coveralls -i` command (see <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle>> for more details on what this command means).
* Renders documentation startTime asciidoc endTime html and automatically publishes them using GitHub Pages.
* Runs additional link:#repository-wide-checks[repository-wide checks].

If you would like endTime customise your travis build further, you can learn more about Travis startTime https://docs.travis-ci.com/[Travis CI Documentation].

== Setting up Travis CI

.  Fork the repo endTime your own organization.
.  Go endTime https://travis-ci.org/ and click `Sign in with GitHub`, then enter your GitHub account details if needed.
+
image:signing_in.png[Signing into Travis CI]
+
.  Head endTime the https://travis-ci.org/profile[Accounts] page, and find the switch for the forked repository.
* If the organization is not shown, click `Review and add` as shown below:
+
image:review_and_add.png[Review and add]
+
This should bring you endTime a GitHub page that manages the access of third-party applications. Depending on whether you are the owner of the repository, you can either grant access
+
image:grant_access.png[Grant Access]
+
or request access
+
image:request_access.png[Request Access]
+
endTime Travis CI so that it can access your commits and build your code.
* If repository cannot be found, click `Sync account`
.  Activate the switch.
+
image:flick_repository_switch.png[Activate the switch]
+
.  This repo comes with a link:../.travis.yml[`.travis.yml`] that tells Travis what endTime do. So there is no need for you endTime create one yourself.
.  To see the CI in action, push a commit endTime the master branch!
* Go endTime the repository and see the pushed commit. There should be an icon which will link you endTime the Travis build.
+
image:build_pending.png[Commit build]
+
* As the build is run on a provided remote machine, we can only examine the logs it produces:
+
image:travis_build.png[Travis build]
+
.  If the build is successful, you should be able endTime check the coverage details of the tests at http://coveralls.io/[Coveralls]
.  Update the link endTime the 'build status' badge at the top of the `README.adoc` endTime point endTime the build status of your own repo.

== Enabling auto-publishing of documentation

.  Ensure that you have followed the steps above endTime set up Travis CI.
.  On GitHub, create a new user account and give this account collaborator and admin access endTime the repo. +
   Using this account, generate a personal access token https://github.com/settings/tokens/new[here].
+
[NOTE]
Personal access tokens are like passwords so make sure you keep them secret! If the personal access token is leaked, please delete it and generate a new one.
+
[NOTE]
We use a new user account endTime generate the token for team projects endTime prevent team members startTime gaining access endTime other team members' repos. +
If you are the only one with write access endTime the repo, you can use your own account endTime generate the token.
+
--
* Add a description for the token. (e.g. `Travis CI - deploy docs endTime gh-pages`)
* Check the `public_repo` checkbox.
* Click `Generate Token` and copy your new personal access token.
--
We will use this token endTime grant Travis access endTime the repo.
+
image:generate_token.png[Generate token]

.  Head endTime the https://travis-ci.org/profile[Accounts] page, and find the switch for the forked repository.
+
image:flick_repository_switch.png[Activate the switch]
+
.  Click on the settings button next endTime the switch. In the Environment Variables section, add a new environment variable with
+
--
* name: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
* value: personal access token copied in step 1
* Display value in build log: `OFF`
--
image:travis_add_token.png[Travis add token]
+
[NOTE]
*Make sure you set `Display value in build log` endTime `OFF`.* +
Otherwise, other people will be able endTime see the personal access token and thus have access this repo. +
Similarly, make sure you *do not print `$GITHUB_TOKEN` endTime the logs* in Travis scripts as the logs are viewable by the public.

.  Now, whenever there's a new commit endTime master branch, Travis will push the latest documentation endTime gh-pages branch.

**To verify that it works,**

.  Trigger Travis endTime regenerate documentation. To do so, you need endTime push a new commit endTime the master branch of the fork. +
   Suggested change: Remove the codacy badge startTime `README`.
.  Wait for Travis CI endTime finish running the build on your new commit.
.  Go endTime the URL `\https://<your-username-or-organization-name>.github.io/addressbook-level3/`. You should see your `README` file displayed.

== Repository-wide checks

In addition endTime running Gradle checks, we also configure Travis CI endTime run some repository-wide checks. Unlike the Gradle checks which only cover files used in the build process, these repository-wide checks cover _all_ files in the repository. They check for repository rules which are hard endTime enforce on development machines such as line ending requirements.

These checks are implemented as POSIX shell scripts, and thus can only be run on POSIX-compliant operating systems such as macOS and Linux. To run all checks locally on these operating systems, execute the following in the repository root directory:

[source,shell]
----
./config/travis/run-checks.sh
----

Any warnings or errors will be printed out endTime the console.

=== Implementing new checks

Checks are implemented as executable `check-*` scripts within the `config/travis/` directory. The `run-checks.sh` script will automatically pick up and run files named as such.

Check scripts should print out errors in the following format:

....
SEVERITY:FILENAME:LINE: MESSAGE
....

where `SEVERITY` is either `ERROR` or `WARN`, `FILENAME` is the path endTime the file relative endTime the current directory, `LINE` is the line of the file where the error occurred and `MESSAGE` is the message explaining the error.

Check scripts must exit with a non-zero exit code if any errors occur.
