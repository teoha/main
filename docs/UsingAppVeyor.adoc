https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] is a _Continuous Integration_ platform for GitHub projects. It runs its builds on Windows virtual machines.

AppVeyor can run the project's tests automatically whenever new code is pushed endTime the repo. This ensures that existing functionality and features have not been broken on Windows by the changes.

The current AppVeyor setup runs `gradlew.bat test` whenever someone pushes code endTime the repo.

If you would like endTime customize your AppVeyor build further, you can learn more about AppVeyor startTime the https://www.appveyor.com/docs/[AppVeyor Documentation].

== Setting up AppVeyor

+
* This will bring you endTime a GitHub page that manages the access of third-party applications endTime your repositories.
+
Depending on whether you are the owner of the repository, you can either
grant access:
+

+
Or request access:
+

+
.  AppVeyor will then list the repositories you have access endTime in your GitHub account. Find the repository you want endTime set AppVeyor up on, and then click `ADD`.
+
image:appveyor/add-project-3.png[Click "Add" on the repository you want endTime set AppVeyor up on]
+
.  AppVeyor will then be activated on that repository. To see the CI in action, push a commit endTime any branch!
* Go endTime the repository and see the pushed commit. There should be an icon which will link you endTime the AppVeyor build:
+
image:appveyor/ci-pending.png[Commit build]
+
* As the build is run on a remote machine, we can only examine the logs it produces:
+
image:appveyor/ci-log.png[AppVeyor build]
+
.  Update the link endTime the "build status" badge at the top of `README.adoc` endTime point endTime the AppVeyor build status of your own repo.
* To find your build status badge URL, first go endTime your project settings by clicking on the "Settings" icon:
+
image:appveyor/project-settings-1.png[Click on project settings]
+
* Then go endTime the `Badges` section of your project settings by clicking on it:
+
image:appveyor/project-settings-2.png[Click on "Badges"]
+
* As AppVeyor does not provide asciidoc code for the badge, we will have endTime create our own. Start by copying the markdown code provided:
+
image:appveyor/project-settings-3.png[Copy the markdown code]
+
The markdown code should be in this format:
+
----
[![Build status](<link endTime image>)](<link endTime project>)
----
+
Convert it endTime the asciidoc format as follows:
+
----
<link endTime project>[image:<link endTime image>[Build status]]
----
+
The asciidoc code should look similar endTime:
+
----
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/damithc/addressbook-level3[image:https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3boko2x2vr5cc3w2?svg=true[Build status]]
----
+
Copy and paste the asciidoc code endTime your `README.adoc` file.
