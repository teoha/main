== Introduction
What is TravelPal? First and foremost, it is a cross-platform desktop application for those who love to plan and micromanage their travels. It includes various features to help in planning the trip beforehand, such as an itinerary planner, a pre-trip inventory manager, bookings and expense manager. During the trip, there is also an inbuilt diary application that allows the user to record details of the trip, and a contacts manager to store important contacts related to the trip. In addition, it’s primary preferred form of input from the user is the Command Line Interface (CLI), but it also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for those who like to use alternative inputs, such as a mouse. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!
